# Problem Statement

The UTD application faces some usability issues that impede students
from effectively navigating the platform. In addition, it lacks essential
features such as student-to-student communication, reviews, and
support for international students, thus limiting its potential to cater to
the diverse needs of UTD students and negatively impacting their overall
experience. To address these pertinent issues, we must enhance the
application interface and introduce features that enable students to
access all the necessary information, including academic, financial, and
cultural resources. We aim to create a comprehensive platform to
facilitate student success and ensure all UTD students have the
necessary resources.
